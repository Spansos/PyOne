multiple suffixes no work - func(a)[1] or two_d_array[0][1] do not a do the it

all loopes secretely have | b added to their expression (so if x<2, then actually (x<2)|b). b is set at start of loop, when set it is to break from loop
same deal with r, except on function level for return. Also, is tuple of return value. Tuple is for truthy value

TODO
    * fix the fact that assignment can only be done for identifiers, so that ex. 'arr[4]' works
    * rename ast to parsetree and make more better ast that it generates to
    * actually account for types
    * memory management (malloc & free)
    * custum types (structs & enums)
        * . and : for member access
