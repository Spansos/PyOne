variables:
    type name value
    ex:
        int i 5
        tuple spam (2, 5)

    type can be most python classes

    compiles to:
        name = (lambda x: lambda: x)([val])
    such that name()[0] can be called to get the exact same reference to val

funcs:
    fun name arg1 arg2
        fun or expres
    
    ret for return value, won't stop func
    fun name arg1 arg2
        ret fun
        fun
    
    func can make func
    fun name arg1 arg2
        ret fun name arg1 arg2
            ret fun

    no var definitions inside function
    this is error-worthy:
        fun name arg1 arg2
            var name value
    
expressions:
    any and all expressions will be implemented as functions

std funcs:
    the family of names of ln[num] (such as ln2, ln5) is reserved
